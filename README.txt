Student Name â€“ Manish Raje  

Hi, my name is Manish Raje. I am taking this course as part of my Masters in Information Systems Engineering degree. I work as an information security consultant in the payments domain for Underwriters labs. My work is focused around helping our clients architect secure payment solutions. I did my bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from the University of California, Berkeley. I am really excited to take this course. My primary interest is to gain experience in working on an Agile development project and use the Ruby on Rails platform to create interesting web pages.  I have some personal project ideas that I would like to convert into working web applications. I look forward to learning a lot this semester!
